This GDK Glassware renders an overhead map on a live card that
updates every few seconds. It uses RemoteViews to render a
[low frequency live card](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/ui/live-cards#creating_low-frequency_live_cards).
It sources maps from the [Google static maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/).

This is not an official sample. In other words, it's not actively
maintained. It last worked as of XE16.

## Usage

1. Install Android Studio (last tested with 0.5.5)
2. [Install the GDK Developer Preview add-on](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/quick-start#setting_up_the_development_environment)
     using the Android SDK Manager
3. Clone this repository, or download the zip file
4. Open it using Android Studio
5. Install it on to your Glass
6. Use the 'Show me a map' voice command to run the demo.
7. A live card is inserted that says "Loading...". Shortly after,
     it updates to show a map.
8. Use this as a foundation for some other cool project.
